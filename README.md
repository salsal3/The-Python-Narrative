*It should be noted that a live demo of the notebook was presented instead of PowerPoint slides.*

## Project Proposal and Outline
Our project looks at two unrelated sets of data. One of the datasets looks into prices of rental apartments across the US, while the other looks at marketprices of Pokémon cards.

The hope and intent of our project is to serve as a learning aid, or at least to lay the foundation for one's development. By weaving an interactive narrative into the teaching process for Python, we hope to make learning some of Python's more complex functions easier to understand for those who might have a difficult time with these concepts.

## Why is this important?
For some people, traditional teaching methods are not effective or efficient means of learning a new skill, even when the material is broken down into bare bones explanations. This is sometimes due to the challenges of working with a neurodiverse brain; such is the case of one of us developers of this project.

Using a combination of story-telling and interactive segments that are reminiscent of a role-playing game, we wanted to explore the creation a learning tool that is more engaging than many of the apps in the market that are meant to help accomplish the same goal.

## What have we found?
After running a live demo to peers, the project - though still in its earliest presentation - was met with positive reception. The development and the execution proved to be strong learning tools, as well.

## What about the data?
The rental apartment data and the Pokémon card data both underwent significant amounts of analysis and cleaning. Both datasets were expansive, and in some ways highly disorganized. The functions and methods used in the process went beyond the scope of the class syllabus thus far.

Our datasets are separated into two pairs of notebooks, with the most relevant data found in the data_analysis notebooks.
